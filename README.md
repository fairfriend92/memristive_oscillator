# memristive_oscillator
Code that simulates the oscillating regime of a general memristive device in parallel to a capacitor. The memristor features a stochastic resistive collapse, similarly to a Mott material under an applied voltage, which occurs with a probability that depends on the applied voltage. The probability is described in Rocco et al. PRA (2022)
